          About Us Welcome to our little corner of the internet! We're a team of
          5 code enthusiasts on a mission to flex our coding muscles (and maybe
          our real ones too). This website is our coding playground, where we
          learn, break things, and hopefully put them back together again! Think
          of it as a gym for code: we lift, we debug, and sometimes we forget to
          stretch (which is why the bugs pop up in the first place!). We're here
          to work out those brain cells, solve coding puzzles, and grow as
          developersâ€”one small bug at a time. No dumbbells required, but a good
          sense of humor? Mandatory.
